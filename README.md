## **Why Reinforcement Learning?**

Imagine you're shopping online for clothes, and the website starts suggesting exactly what you’re looking for—styles, colors, and brands you love. The more you browse, the better the suggestions get, almost like the website is reading your mind.

This is **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in action. It learns from your choices and improves with every click, making your shopping experience faster and more personalized.

### **So, why should you care?**

Because RL is behind the technology that’s making your favorite apps smarter, and it’s shaping the future of how machines understand us.

## In this repository, let's explore RL using a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

> **Exploration vs Exploitation**
> 
> In Reinforcement Learning, **exploration** refers to trying new actions to discover better long-term strategies, while **exploitation** is about choosing the best-known actions based on past experiences. Striking the right balance between exploration and exploitation is crucial for an efficient RL model.
