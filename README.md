## **Why Reinforcement Learning?**

Imagine you're shopping online for clothes, and the website starts suggesting exactly what you’re looking for—styles, colors, and brands you love. The more you browse, the better the suggestions get, almost like the website is reading your mind.

This is **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** in action. It learns from your choices and improves with every click, making your shopping experience faster and more personalized.

### **So, why should you care?**

Because RL is behind the technology that’s making your favorite apps smarter, and it’s shaping the future of how machines understand us.

## In this repository, let's explore RL using a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

> **Exploration vs Exploitation**
> 
> Imagine you’re in **Guwahati**, walking down **Paltan Bazaar**, deciding where to grab a quick bite.

- **Exploitation**: You’ve been to the same **momos** stall for a long time, and you know their momos are always fresh and delicious. You choose to go there again because you know you’ll enjoy them every time.
- **Exploration**: But there’s another **momos** stall nearby that you’ve never tried before. You’re not sure if their momos are as good, but you decide to give them a try, hoping to discover something new and maybe even better.

At first, you might explore and try the new stall, but after a few visits, you’ll start to notice which momos taste better or have a better price. Eventually, you’ll start going to the stall that you like the most. Over time, you’ll strike the perfect balance between exploring new momos stalls to discover hidden gems and sticking to the one that consistently delivers the best taste and satisfaction.

In **Reinforcement Learning**, this process is similar. Initially, the algorithm might try different actions (exploration) to learn about possible outcomes. But as it learns from the feedback, it starts to focus on the actions that give the best results (exploitation). As the learning process continues, the algorithm converges to a point where it consistently makes the best choices, just like you will keep going to the momos stall that suits your taste the most!
